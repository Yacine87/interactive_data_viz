# interactive_data_viz
You will find in this repository exemples of interactive data visualisation with Shiny and other R pakages 
This work has been presented in the 2019 Algerian R users group Meetup, organised in August, 2019 in Algiers, Algeria.

The data used in this exemple are about movies. 
The file contains 651 obs (films) discribed with 34 features. 
You can load the data file following : http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_4850/datasets/movies.Rdata

The aim of this shiny app is to visualise interactively the movies' file data. Three possibilities are given: 
1/ Visualise interactively Numeric vs numric variables through scatterplot (geom_point() from R ggplot2 package)
2/ Visualise interactively Factor variables  (geom_bar() from R ggplot2 package)
3/ Visualise interactively numeric vs factor  variables  

It gaves to the user also the possibiliy to facet interactively the shown plots by checkiing a checkboxInput() (facet_wrap() function of the ggplot2 package)

You can use the app with an other data file. 
But you need first to modify the file name (from movies to yours) and variable names in the argument choices() of the inputSelect() funtion in the R code.
